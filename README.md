# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Album Finder

A React-based project that lets users search for any artist and view their albums using the Spotify Web API.

This project was built by following [Codedexâ€™s tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-an-album-finder-with-spotify-api).  
It helped me understand how to interact with public APIs, handle authentication, and manage state in a React app.
